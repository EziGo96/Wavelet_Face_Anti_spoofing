% The dual-tree complex DWT of a signal x is implemented
% using two critically-sampled DWTs in parallel on the same data
% The transform is 2-times expansive 
% because for an N-point signal it gives 2N DWT coefficients

% if the filters are designed is a specific way, 
% then the subband signals of the upper DWT 
% can be interpreted as the real part of a complex wavelet transform,
% and subband signals of the lower DWT can be interpreted as the imaginary part
